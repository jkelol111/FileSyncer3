# FileSyncer
FileSyncer is a Python Tkinter application that syncs files and sub-directories from a source directory to a target directory. The main purpose of this application is to sync up folders across a network where bandwidth is a factor. Any existing files or sub-directories in the target directory will be deleted if they are not found in the source directory. If any files or sub-directories in the target directory do exist in source directory, they will be updated to match the correponding item in the source directory. FileSyncer is written in Python 2.7. To run the application, double-click the script if python scripts are set to run as executables or download an executable for your operating system from the dist folder.
