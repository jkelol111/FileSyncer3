# FileSyncer
Python Tkinter application that syncs files and subdirectories from a source directory to a target directory. Any existing files
or subdirectories in target directory will be deleted if they are not in the source directory. If any files or subdirectories in 
target directory do exist in source directory, they will be updated to match the correponding item in the source directory. Application is written in Python 2.7. To run application, double-click in OS if python scripts are set to run as executables. Next steps include improving UI/UX and publishing into an executable application using Pyinstaller.
